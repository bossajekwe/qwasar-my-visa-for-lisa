## Task
The Task involved cleaning, analysing and carrying out a  machine learning Task(classification) on a Banks Customer database (stored as a csv).

## Description
To solve this problem I have import various modules such as the sklearn module which is a popular module
for machine learning operations in python. 

for me to be able to visualize my analysis I have imported both the plotly and seaborn modules.
process
1. I imported pandas  to Load in the data.
2. Since there are no missing values, I assigned the right data types to features in the dataset.
3. Imported the seaborn library to plot the histograms and heatmap of the dataset.
4. Import the sklearn module which is an extensive module for Machine learning and its other operations.

## Installation
This project does not need any form of Installation, however, for this project to work effectively, Jupyter Notebooks has 
to be installed in the local through Anaconda.

## Usage
To be able to use this script, it has to be opened in a jupyter notebook. Also, the csv must also be present in the same
same directory as the script. While the script is open in Jupyter
Notebook, You can go to Menu, and click on `cells` and click on the option `Run all Cells`.
